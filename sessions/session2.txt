## Recap
Last time we had woken up in a strange new world.  After this we were told we
were immortal and chosen - sent to kill a great evil (the man in the (tower).
We were only told to take the east road.  after this we trained for 2 weeks in
our classes.  Then we traveld into town and bought our equipment - learned from
things about these people.  Then we killed people, boiught and elephant and
some of us died and were reborn.

We purchased a map of the city we started in (Goany Ford) and were informed
about one of the roads listed on the map that heads to Oah.  We headed down
that river, traveled for a day until we hit a place along the river.  We set up
camp along the west side of the river.

  killed
    - we see ashes on the other side of the river, and a goblin standing over
      them
