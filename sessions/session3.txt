While Jackson was on first watch he went and cleaned up the corpses

Ray wakes up and takes final watch
    He sees the sun rise up and shadows from the low ruined walls

    The dawnlight hits the ashes in the bucket and cassie crawls out as a new
    person
        she is a 5'4" man who is short and chubby and blond

    Jackson fills Cassie in quietly

We see some things in the area
    along the northern wall(we're in the city square)
        - there is a mural of three different cities

    to the left of us there is a crate with something sparkling

    to the east there are some bedrools and shit

    to the south of us are some goblin weapons
        Sean grabs some bolts and arrows
            14 arrow, 19 crossbow bolts

        I grab a short bow
            as get up  I  see a giant floating cube that is dripping water

Jackson looks around for goblins and doesn't see anything

I look into the sparkling crate
    inside there is a collection of gems and vials full of liquid

    the stones are 2 x bloodstone, jasper, carnelian, chryosphere, moonstone
        the are all thuimb size, worth about 50gp

    the potions are
        there are 4
        one has a pic of a shield
            ray takes this

        one has a heart
            I take this

        one has an animal

        and the last one has a man flexing
            sean takes this

    Everyone except me does an arcana check on the potions
        Sean finds out the flexing one is a potion of hill giant strength

        Ray finds out the animal potion is a potion of animal frendship

        Jakson realizes that the heart potion is a potion of love


The murals
    - one of the paitingins is a mayan temple with a jungle and sun

    - the one in the middle is a beautiful castle city with a silver dragon on
      top.  There is a bidge in from of the castle

    - on the left, the painting has a  military fort with soldiers in front

    - these are all individual

    - I make a quick sketch of all of the paintings

Check out the beadrolls
    - they are really messy and dirty, like someone was ust sleeping in them
      and they didn't clean up

    - ray thinks that these were used very recently


Sean and Jackson gag the goblin
    they shove a blanket down its throat

    it wakes up in the process

    Jackson slaps the goblin on the cheek and says
        "Pay attention"
        THe goblin is even more afraid
        "You are going to have to be very quiet or we will kill you. Blah blah
        blah I'm scary"

    He says that the leader is "Warlord Zoo"

    The cube is a big bad thing of water, poison or something

    I gave him some water, he is very scared

    The goblin says that he knows things after ray slaps him
        "I know things!" the goblin says
        "like what" ray asks and slaps him again
        "FoodGood"

        I ask him about the cities
        "Old cities long ago, full of white ones, red ones, but no green ones"

        "Stop dark ones, flanking mountain"
        "They are thin dark dark and pointy"

        "The dark ones are afraid of the light"

        He points up to the mountains to the north when I ask him about them

        We tryied to get the goblin to like us, sean named him boo.

        He passes out

        We leave him untied and we leave him some food and water
        Ray also leaves a note telling him what we are doing

We all go to check out the cube
    When we get over to the cube square, we see two lorge humanoid hairy things
    they are wearing some leather thing and have giant wooden clubs with spikes

    they are both sleeping


Jackson and Casssie stay down at the bottom

I go into the middle and prepare in case there is conflict

Ray and Sean go up to the top to try and check out the cube
    Sean is fake tied up
    Ray is disquized as a hobgoblin leading him

    THey both stealth with nat 20s

    The cube
        - it is dripping water into a circular stone well
            - it was obviously not designed for this

    Sean captures some water in a flask
        - he notices that it is not poison or anything.. it seems to be holy
          water

        - he keeps the water in the flask

    Ray fills a waterskin with it

    Sean dips his arrows with it

    Ray goes to poke the cube with something
        sean is like NO, pulls on the rope with his arms

Sean and Ray go back the way that we came, get Me and Cassie and Jackson

We go back to the camp

Cassie does a religion check on the water
    - the water is blessed by a diety of celestials
    - the church is from the church of light

Jackson drank some of the water and it tasted good

Ray put a goblin hair in the water and nothing happened
    Ray puts holy water in boo's mouth, nothing happens

We wake boo up gently
    We ask him about the hairy guys, they're scouts for warlord zoo

    we let him sleep

We decide to try and search thd city stealthfully
    WHen we get to the west side of town, we see another set of betrolls and
    pots

    we don't see any goblins, there doesn't seem to be any people

    we see another mutal
        a well
        someone with white platemail with green (slady)
            he's doing the praise the sun thing

        I make a sketch

    We continue exploring

    When we get to the north area
        we peer over and we see a camp with goblins

        Cassie trips and fall

        Sean pushes us all down onto the ground

    We try to convince them that we are here to pay tribute to warlord zoo

    He doesn't believe us and tells his goblins to attack us

Combat
    the two goblins attack sean with scimitars

    the first goblin swings at sean and misses

    the second goblin swings at sean and cuts off the others leg

        he stabs forward and somehow hits sean

    Sean Yells:
        "I've been stabbed!"

    The hobgoblin runs over and swings his longsword at sean
        sean backs up and barely misses getting decapitated
        then he raises his shield back up

    I run through our group and attack the one remaining goblin with the
    scimitar
        I swing down with my greatsword and miss

    Sean moves to the other side of the goblin I just attacked
        he attacks and hits perfectly on his neck he cuts his head clean off
        blood spews everywhere

    Jackson casts eldrich blast
        The hobgoblin is like "nah brah" and raises his shield to block it

    Cassie then casts sacred flame at the hob goblin
        the hobgoblin just jumps right up in the air and jumps over the flame

    Ray casts firebolt at the hobgoblin and he uses his shield to block the
    firebolt

        I take 8 damage

    The hobgoblin swings down onto seans head
        Sean gets knocked unconcious

        - I pivot to use the hobgoblin as a shield

    Cassie stabalizes Sean

    Jackson runs around to the other side of the goblin with the dagger

    Ray casts sleep and the hobgoblin falls asleep

    The one with the dagger runs away

I hog tie the Hobgoblin (gently as to not wake him.. ray insisted)
    I make sure that he will not be able to break free

Jackson goes and tries to attack the goblin
    he sees goblin tracks and runs in the direction of goblin tracks

    He dashes in that direction, doesn't see anything

Ray runs up to investigate what happened to the goblin
    ray sees some foot prints and a hole in the wall

    Ray yells out to jackson, and jackson turns around to go investigate

Jackson goes and tries to parkcore over the wall
    Jackson is able to do it

    He lands on the other side of the goblin, and the goblin stabs him in the
    back

    The goblin's dagger gets stuck in Jackson's armor

        Sean stabs the goblin through the head

Sean pulls the dagger out of the goblin's chainmail
    it is a dagger of reach

I try to intimidate the hobgoblin... he breaks free of the ropes
    he gets up and grabs me

    He tries to shove me to the ground, I'm able to resist

Cassie looks around, she finds a crate
    She finds 33 crosbow bolts


We try to sneak back to the camp
    we hear a large number of footsteps running into the area

    we didn't hear them pursuing us


We get to our camp and we leave out of town

        "There aren't any goblins over there any more!"

        Then he runs down the area in between the buildings towards the rest of
        the group kinda (but not inside the building like the rest of us are)

        He holds his action in case he sees someone

    The two goblins let loose arrows at Jackson
        the two arrows hit jackson in the chest
        then the goblins run away


The group started making weird noises again, why do they sing so many weird
songs


    Then a hob goblin starts coming from the north

    The big hairy guy comes from the west with his
        Sean shouts "GIANT!"

    Jackson runs back the other way and says "Plan B"
        he makes it back into the alley way going south

    Cassie runs up to jackson and shouts
        "The power of christ compells you!" and then slaps him in the back of
        the head

        He gets hp from this

    I run around and next to the passage way and hold my action
        I will dash as soon as  sean moves down the hallway area

    Ray casts grease in front of the hairy dude and kinda where he is standing
        he moves down towards the hallway

    Sean again says "Plan B"
        he looks at the bugbear and down the road

        he runs down the hallway

    I run in front, sean runs with me

    We are running towards the base but everything is blocked off


    The bug bear slips on the grease and falls down

    A goblin shoots an arrow through the same hole that was there before
        then the goblin runs south

    Then the hobgoblin shows up with his bow aimed at ray

    Cassie hugs the wall, peeks over and casts sacred flame at the prone bug
    bear
        she hits the bug bear

        he bursts into yellow flames and she can smell nasty burning dog hair
        the creature goes "RASSUGGHHGHH"
            he doesn't seem like he dislikes it to much

    I try to jump over the wall and fail
        then I run 15 feet to the east
        then I use my action to jump on the wall

    Ray peeks over and casts fire bolt at the bugbear
        it kinda misses the bug bear but sets him on fire because of the grease
        that he is in

    Sean jumps over the wall onto the same building Jackson and I are on
        he uses his action to dash and moves pretty far south

    There are three goblins to the east
        as they run past the narrow hallway they shoot an arrow towards cassie
        and ray but it falls short

    We hear "thud squeek" "thud squeek" as the flaming bug bear runs towards
    ray and cassie

    Jackson tries to hop over the wall
        he fails and loses 15 feet of movement

        he dashes, uses 15 feet to hop the wall, then he moves 15 more feet
        south

    Cassie dashes down the hallway and moves south
        an arrow hits her from behind and gets caught in her scale mail

        there is a hob goblin right next to cassie

    I hop over the wall, then I wait by a corner for cassie

    Ray dashes and hops up on the wal and moves perpendicular to sean and
    jackson (but up on the wall)

    Sean dashes prety far south

    Ray hears the thud, squish noise
        then all of a sudden wood flies into the wall and it gets smashed down

    Cassie hears a sword being unsheathed from behind her
        then the hob goblin stabs at her

        it gets caught in her scale armor and veers off to the side

    Two goblins come off from the side of cassie

    Two arrows fly out and get caught in jackson's chain mail


    The other bug bear starts running towards sean

    Jackson hex blade curses the first bug bear next to ray
        he tries to hop over the wall and fails, just doesn't quite make it,
        doesn't fall down

    Cassie disengages the hob goblin and runs towards me, hugging the corner
        as she rounds the corner, arrows hit cassie

    I get behind the corner, ready to attack anything that passes by

    Ray jumps down from the wall next to the bug bear
        he is not in the same enclosure as me and cassie

        he casts fire bolt at the bug bear
            the bug bear catches on fire, singed to all hell, then falls to the
            ground dead

    Sean walks right up to the bug bear, and he attacks
        he sinks his sword into his flesh kinda, then pulls his sword out

        then he moves kinda to the other side of the bug bear

        then he uses an action surge, moves towards the bomb, puts away his
        weapon and grabs a bomb

    The bug bear uses his entire morement to try and get over the wall that
    jackson is on
        the bug bear is a fat piece of shit though and the wall collapses

        He is now inside the building

        He takes his big stick and slams it at jackson
            this hits the back wall, delaying the attack just long enough for
            jackson to move out of the way

    The hob goblin moves right behind cassie
        he stabs at cassie

        the sword goes through her shield and stops just shy of her chestinto

    Two arrows fly from behind sean and go just right over his head
        he looks back and can't see where they came from

    Jackson moves and then the bug bear gets an attack of oportunity
        jackson casted shield to try and defent, but the bug bear's mighty
        attack was able to break through

        This knocks Jackson unconcious
            blood drips off of the bug bear's body

    Cassie runs away

    I round the corner rage, swing at the hob goblin with my axe
        It pierces into his body and instantly kills him

        then run forward and hide behind a corner

    Ray move up towards cassie
        he shot a firebolt at the bugbear and the bug bear catches on fire

    Sean runs up towards the bug bear
        he lites the flash bomb and tosses it up onto the building with the bug
        bear

    the bug bear picks up jackson into the air and walks towards Sean
        he's using jackson's body as a shield

        he swings at sean with his chunk of building
            the chunk hits sean right on the shield

            it gets stuck in the shield and then the bug bear uses this to rip
            the shield from sean's hands

    Two arrows fly towards towards sean from the south east
        one hits sean right in the chest

    I dash south and then break through a wall
        all the while yelling "RAAAAAAHHHHHGHGHGHGHGHGHGHG!!!!!"
        after i break through the wall a goblin shoots an arrow at me

        a chunk of building from the wall I just knocked down knocks the arrow
        out of the air

    Ray attempts to put the bug bear to sleep
        she goes "Slumber! slumber.. slumber...."

        the bug bear falls asleep and drops jackson onto the ground

        the bug bear falls on top of sean
            sean is barely able to hold up the bug bear, he is slowly losing
            his grip

    sean then sean lets the bug bear fall a bit
        sean drinks his potion of hill giant strength
        sean kicks the bug bear up onto the building right by the bomb

        the bomb is right between his legs and then goes "BOOM"

        the bug bear aint dead though somehow...

    The bug bear gets up and yells out
        the bug bear moves to the other side of the building right next to sean
        and jackson

        the bug bear swings his thing at the sean
            the tip hits sean and he is knocked unconsious

    From behind me, two arrows hit me
        one flies way over

        the other skims across my leg and deals 3 damage

    the other goblin around the corner shoots an arrow at me

    I dash over towards the bug bear and my party members

    Ray jumps up and casts fire bolt at the bug bear
        the bug bear is encompased inside of a nuclear blast as the bug bear is
        charred and falls onto the ground on top of sean

        sean catches the bug bear by the spike that is about to impale him in
        the face

    We hear the goblins screaming and running away

    Cassie stabalizes jackson

Looking around the town we find:
    a bunch of gems

    10 gems worth 50 gp each

    a potion with a fire on it
        some kind of fire breathing device

    a scroll with writing on it
        ray looks at the scroll
            he knows its a scroll of third level magic

            mass healing word


    around the neck of the bug bear that was going to kill sean we find a ring
        jackson does an arcana check on the ring
            he can tell that its some sort of ring of spell storing
